A genetic algorithm that finds the optimal job shop layout 


The facility layout problem is a fundamental problem in manufacturing engineering and
operations research. The problem seeks a solution which defines the positions of machines or
departments within the facility such that material handling costs are minimized. An optimal
solution to this problem will be invaluable to the company it serves as it will reduce time wasted
in material handling between departments, thereby increasing the efficiency of the operation,
reducing cycle time, and increasing throughput.

This algorithm takes a distance matrix (distance between each station in the facility) and a flow matrix (defining the interactions between each department) and uses mutations, crossovers, and evaluations of offspring fitness to determine the optimal layout based on distance and flow. See report for more details.
